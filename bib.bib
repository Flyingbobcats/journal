Traditionally obstacle avoidance has been a high level controls problem (Esentially, don't even go in that area)
PF lets you distribute avoidance into multiple layers of control
PF implemented into a robotic manipulator
Time varying Potential field for moving obstacles

 

Operational Space Formulation is the basis for the application of the potential field approach to robot manipulators
 


Paper focuses strongly on the fundamentals of the operational space formulation and the artificial potential field concept
Lagrangian equation (minimal energy, principle of least action)

 
Artificial Potential Field Approach

Presented in the context of manipulator collision avoidance


The manipulator moves in a field of forces. The position to be reached is an attractive pole for the end effector and obstacles are repulsive surfaces for the manipulator parts

 

Artificial forces are applied to the manipulator from the PF, which are determined by the negative gradient
The field, if interpreted straight up, will give both direction and magnitude. In this instance, the magnitude is limited to some v\_max, but the direction is maintained
Obstacle field should be nonnegative, continuous, and differentiable, tend to infinity

 

Used a peicewise decay function (my words, not Khatib's) to limit the influence of the obstacle

 

Local minima can occur in the resultant potential field...this can lead to a stable positioning of the robot before reaching its goal

In particular, this paper presents a set of analytical guidelines for designing potential functions to avoid local minima in a trap situation (in this case, the robot is trapped in a local minimum by the potential of obstacles). The virtual escaping route method is proposed to allow a robot to escape from a local minimum in a trap situation where the total forces are composed of repulsive forces by obstacles and attractive force by a goal are zero. The example results show that the proposed scheme can effectively construct a path planning system with the capability of reaching a goal and avoiding obstacles, despite a trapped situation under possible local minima.},

By analyzing the shortcoming of the artificial potential field methods for robot path planning, we propose an obstacle avoidance method based on gravity chain. Suppose that there is a rubber band which connects with the beginning and the ending in the obstacle potential field space. As the rubber band will be the role of potential field power, we can build a model to simulate the shape of the rubber band. Then this method will generate a steer angle tangent to the rubber band instead of the angle of artificial potential field. By putting effective obstacle avoidance information into potential field through gravity chain, we solve the problems that the artificial potential field method often converges to local minima, as well as it hardly reach the ending and oscillatory movement. The Simulation results show that the method proposed is correct and effective.},

In this paper, we present an improved artificial potential field based regression search (Improved APF-based RS) method which can obtain a global sub-optimal/optimal path efficiently without local minima and oscillations in complete known environment information. We redefine potential functions to eliminate non-reachable and local minima problems, and utilize virtual local target for robot to escape oscillations. Due to the planned path by improved APF is not the shortest/approximate shortest trajectory, we develop a regression search (RS) method to optimize the planned path. The optimization path is calculated by connecting the sequential points which produced by improved APF. Amount of simulations demonstrate that the improved APF method very easily escape from local minima and oscillatory movements. Moreover, the simulation results confirm that our proposed path planning approach could always calculate a more global optimal/nearoptimal, collision-free and safety path to its destination compare with general APF. That proves our improved APF-based RS method very feasibility and efficiency to solve path planning which is a NP-hard problem for autonomous mobile robot.},

	abstract = {Fixed Wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) performing Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) typically ﬂy over Areas of Interest (AOIs) to collect sensor data of the ground from the air. If needed, the traditional method of extending sensor collection time is to loiter or turn circularly around the center of an AOI. Current Autopilot systems on small UAVs can be limited in their feature set and typically follow a waypoint chain system that allows for loitering, but requires that the center of the AOI to be traversed which may produce unwanted turns outside of the AOI before entering the loiter. An investigation was performed to compare the current loitering techniques against two novel smart loitering methods. The ﬁrst method investigated, Tangential Loitering Path Planner (TLPP), utilized paths tangential to the AOIs to enter and exit efﬁciently, eliminating unnecessary turns outside of the AOI. The second method, Least Distance Loitering Path Planner (LDLPP), utilized four unique ﬂight maneuvers that reduce transit distances while eliminating unnecessary turns outside of the AOI present in the TLPP method. Simulation results concluded that the Smart Loitering Methods provide better AOI coverage during six mission scenarios. It was also determined that the LDLPP method spends less time in transit between AOIs. The reduction in required transit time could be used for surveying additional AOIs.},
