In particular, this paper presents a set of analytical guidelines for designing potential functions to avoid local minima in a trap situation (in this case, the robot is trapped in a local minimum by the potential of obstacles). The virtual escaping route method is proposed to allow a robot to escape from a local minimum in a trap situation where the total forces are composed of repulsive forces by obstacles and attractive force by a goal are zero. The example results show that the proposed scheme can effectively construct a path planning system with the capability of reaching a goal and avoiding obstacles, despite a trapped situation under possible local minima.},

By analyzing the shortcoming of the artificial potential field methods for robot path planning, we propose an obstacle avoidance method based on gravity chain. Suppose that there is a rubber band which connects with the beginning and the ending in the obstacle potential field space. As the rubber band will be the role of potential field power, we can build a model to simulate the shape of the rubber band. Then this method will generate a steer angle tangent to the rubber band instead of the angle of artificial potential field. By putting effective obstacle avoidance information into potential field through gravity chain, we solve the problems that the artificial potential field method often converges to local minima, as well as it hardly reach the ending and oscillatory movement. The Simulation results show that the method proposed is correct and effective.},

In this paper, we present an improved artificial potential field based regression search (Improved APF-based RS) method which can obtain a global sub-optimal/optimal path efficiently without local minima and oscillations in complete known environment information. We redefine potential functions to eliminate non-reachable and local minima problems, and utilize virtual local target for robot to escape oscillations. Due to the planned path by improved APF is not the shortest/approximate shortest trajectory, we develop a regression search (RS) method to optimize the planned path. The optimization path is calculated by connecting the sequential points which produced by improved APF. Amount of simulations demonstrate that the improved APF method very easily escape from local minima and oscillatory movements. Moreover, the simulation results confirm that our proposed path planning approach could always calculate a more global optimal/nearoptimal, collision-free and safety path to its destination compare with general APF. That proves our improved APF-based RS method very feasibility and efficiency to solve path planning which is a NP-hard problem for autonomous mobile robot.},

	abstract = {Fixed Wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) performing Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) typically ﬂy over Areas of Interest (AOIs) to collect sensor data of the ground from the air. If needed, the traditional method of extending sensor collection time is to loiter or turn circularly around the center of an AOI. Current Autopilot systems on small UAVs can be limited in their feature set and typically follow a waypoint chain system that allows for loitering, but requires that the center of the AOI to be traversed which may produce unwanted turns outside of the AOI before entering the loiter. An investigation was performed to compare the current loitering techniques against two novel smart loitering methods. The ﬁrst method investigated, Tangential Loitering Path Planner (TLPP), utilized paths tangential to the AOIs to enter and exit efﬁciently, eliminating unnecessary turns outside of the AOI. The second method, Least Distance Loitering Path Planner (LDLPP), utilized four unique ﬂight maneuvers that reduce transit distances while eliminating unnecessary turns outside of the AOI present in the TLPP method. Simulation results concluded that the Smart Loitering Methods provide better AOI coverage during six mission scenarios. It was also determined that the LDLPP method spends less time in transit between AOIs. The reduction in required transit time could be used for surveying additional AOIs.},

	abstract = {Structural damage assessment is critical after disasters but remains a challenge. Many studies have explored the potential of remote sensing data, but limitations of vertical data persist. Oblique imagery has been identiﬁed as more useful, though the multi-angle imagery also adds a new dimension of complexity. This paper addresses damage assessment based on multi-perspective, overlapping, very high resolution oblique images obtained with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). 3-D point-cloud assessment for the entire building is combined with detailed object-based image analysis (OBIA) of façades and roofs. This research focuses not on automatic damage assessment, but on creating a methodology that supports the often ambiguous classiﬁcation of intermediate damage levels, aiming at producing comprehensive per-building damage scores. We identify completely damaged structures in the 3-D point cloud, and for all other cases provide the OBIA-based damage indicators to be used as auxiliary information by damage analysts. The results demonstrate the usability of the 3-D point-cloud data to identify major damage features. Also the UAV-derived and OBIA-processed oblique images are shown to be a suitable basis for the identiﬁcation of detailed damage features on façades and roofs. Finally, we also demonstrate the possibility of aggregating the multi-perspective damage information at building level.},

New applications in the short- and close-range domain are introduced, being the UAVs a low-cost alternatives to the classical manned aerial photogrammetry. Rotary or fixed wing UAVs, capable of performing the photogrammetric data acquisition with amateur or SLR digital cameras, can fly in manual, semi-automated and autonomous modes. With a typical photogrammetric pipeline, 3D results like DSM/DTM, contour lines, textured 3D models, vector data, etc. can be produced, in a reasonable automated way. The paper reports the latest developments of UAV image processing methods for photogrammetric applications, mapping and 3D modeling issues. Automation is nowadays necessary and feasible at the image orientation, DSM generation and orthophoto production stages, while accurate feature extraction is still an interactive procedure. New perspectives are also addressed.},

Premature convergence prevents evolutionary-based algorithms from reaching global optimal solutions. This often leads to unsatisfactory routes that are suboptimal to optimal path planning problems. To overcome this problem, this paper presents a framework of parallel evolutionary algorithms for UAV path planning, in which several populations evolve simultaneously and compete with each other. The parallel evolution technique provides more exploration capability to planners and significantly reduces the probability that planners are trapped in local optimal solutions.},

	abstract = {This paper identifies feasible fight paths for Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems in a highly constrained environment. Optimal control software has long been used for vehicle path planning and has proven most successful when an adequate initial guess is presented flight to an optimal control solver. Leveragingfast geometric planning techniques, a large search space is discretized into a set of simplexes where a Dubins path solution is generated and contained in a polygonal search corridor free of path constraints. Direct optimal control methods are then used to determine the optimal flight path through the newly defined search corridor. Two scenarios are evaluated. The first is limited to heading rate control only, requiring the air vehicle to maintain constant speed. The second allows for velocity control which permits slower speeds, reducing the vehicles minimum turn radius and increasing the search domain. Results illustrate the benefits gained when including speed control to path planning algorithms by comparing trajectory and convergence times, resulting in a reliable, hybrid solution method to the SUAS constrained optimal control problem.},

	abstract = {A fundamental aspect of autonomous vehicle guidance is planning trajectories. Historically, two ﬁelds have contributed to trajectory or motion planning methods: robotics and dynamics and control. The former typically have a stronger focus on computational issues and real-time robot control, while the latter emphasize the dynamic behavior and more speciﬁc aspects of trajectory performance. Guidance for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), including ﬁxed- and rotary-wing aircraft, involves signiﬁcant differences from most traditionally deﬁned mobile and manipulator robots. Qualities characteristic to UAVs include non-trivial dynamics, three-dimensional environments, disturbed operating conditions, and high levels of uncertainty in state knowledge. Otherwise, UAV guidance shares qualities with typical robotic motion planning problems, including partial knowledge of the environment and tasks that can range from basic goal interception, which can be precisely speciﬁed, to more general tasks like surveillance and reconnaissance, which are harder to specify. These basic planning problems involve continual interaction with the environment. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of existing motion planning algorithms while adding perspectives and practical examples from UAV guidance approaches.},
